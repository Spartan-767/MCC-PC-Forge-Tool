DESCRIPTION:
--------------------------------------------
This tool was created for the Master Chief Collection on Steam, included are both a Windows 
and a Linux version. Their is also the included mod files and details on how to manually perform 
this, this tool will automatically allow you to create 2 new folders one to store a copy of the 
mod files and one to store a copy of the Original Files. I Suggest you Create these files inside 
the folder for the Master Chief Collection under steamapps.

Compatability:
--------------------------------------------
Linux any version that isn't outdated as fuck
Windows requires windows 10 with git installed for windows
Mac will be supported in future versions




INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------------------------------
Please first select option 2 and set the path to the MCC Directory, you should use the path to
the folder named 'Halo The Master Chief Collection' specifically. Then you may use the first option
to easily turn forge on and off.

Windows Usage:
--------------------------------------------
Please use the tool to create the two folders for the mod file and the original files. The mod
files will automatically be placed in the proper folders as well as your original files being 
copied and pasted into the original folder. I didn't include those in case it contained user 
specific data and to prevent any acciedental alarming like piracy, which could be a risk. In 
order to run bash scripts on your windows computer you need to install the windows git shell
that was just released by windows for windows 10. You can find the homepage for that tool here
https://git-scm.com/download/win and as always virus scan any link or files you use at virustotal
found at https://www.virustotal.com/gui/. Once you install the git shell you can juse double click
the HaloMod.sh file and it will run allowing you to use it with no other dependancies. 


Linux Usage:
--------------------------------------------
Linux users will doubtfully need any help using this and your version is more simple plugin the
directory paths for the folders where the mod files and orignal files are located. Also please 
plugin the file path for the reach maps folder and the windows pak folder. Ex:
